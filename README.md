# Experiment: Content Generation Using Prompt Engineering Techniques

## **Aim**
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be used to create high-quality content such as reports, articles, case studies, and creative works. This experiment shows how different prompt structures influence the quality, coherence, and depth of AI-generated content.

## **Prompt Technique Overview**

### **Prompt Types and Their Effects**

| Prompt Type        | Description                                                                 | Tool Effectiveness                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simple Prompt      | Short, direct instruction (e.g., "A car driving.")                          | Runway: Generates basic, generic video. Pictory: Finds a related stock clip.      |
| Detailed Prompt    | Rich description (e.g., "A red car driving on a wet road at night.")        | Runway: Adds detail and realism. Pictory: Sometimes fails to match all specifics. |
| Motion Prompt      | Adds movement (e.g., "Camera zooming out slowly.")                          | Runway: Interprets motion accurately. Not applicable to Pictory.                  |
| Stylistic Prompt   | Defines aesthetic (e.g., "Animated cyberpunk city scene.")                  | Runway: Changes style fully. Not applicable to Pictory.                           |

## **Procedure**

### **1. Introduction to Prompt Patterns**
Understand the major prompt patterns:

- **Query Decomposition** – Breaking down a big question into smaller tasks.
- **Decision Making** – Asking the model to choose between given options.
- **Answer Engineering** – Giving strict instructions on structure and formatting.
- **Fact Check List** – Ensuring accuracy for reports, case studies.
- **Tail Generation** – Extending content logically for more depth.
- **Menu Actions** – Giving a list of possible actions for the model to select.
- **Semantic Filtering** – Controlling tone, clarity, creativity, or technicality.

---

### **2. Choosing the Content Type**
Select one type of content, such as:

- Business Report  
- Case Study  
- Article  
- Sci-Fi Short Story  
- Educational Report  
- Travel Blog  
- Research Paper  
- Awareness Campaign  
- Product Launch Announcement  
- Sustainability Practices Report  

---

### **3. Creating Initial Prompts**
Start with a simple prompt:

> "Write a short report about market trends."

Then evolve into advanced prompts:

- Add constraints  
- Add tone and style  
- Add role-play (e.g., “Act as a business analyst…”)  
- Add structure control  
- Add fact checklist  

---

### **4. Generating & Refining Outputs**
Use multiple rounds:

1. **First Draft:** Basic generation  
2. **Refinement:** Add decision-making  
3. **Depth Extension:** Add tail generation  
4. **Styling:** Use semantic filters  
5. **Verification:** Apply fact checks  

---

### **5. Review & Evaluation Criteria**
After generating content, check:

- **Coherence** – Does the flow make sense?
- **Creativity** – Is the content unique?
- **Accuracy** – Factual correctness for reports or research.
- **Tone & Style** – Does the content match the intent (formal, casual, creative)?

## **Test Case Scenarios (Choose Any 2)**

- Business Report on Market Trends  
- Case Study on Business Success  
- Article on Climate Change  
- Sci-Fi Short Story  
- Educational Report on Renewable Energy  
- Product Launch Announcement  
- Travel Blog Post  
- Research Paper on Artificial Intelligence  
- Interview Transcript  
- Sustainability Report (Fashion Industry)  
- Social Issue Awareness Campaign  
- AI in Healthcare Analysis  

---

## **Instructions for Conducting the Experiment**

1. **Select a Topic**  
   Choose your scenario (e.g., climate change article, sci-fi story).

2. **Use Basic Prompts**  
   Generate the first draft using simple instructions.

3. **Refine the Prompts**  
   Apply:
   - decision making  
   - query decomposition  
   - semantic filtering  
   - fact-check prompts  
   - format constraints  

4. **Evaluate Output**  
   Check clarity, creativity, coherence, accuracy.

5. **Iterate and Improve**  
   Regenerate with better prompts.

## **Deliverables**

| Deliverable | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **First Draft** | Generated using simple prompts. |
| **Refined Content** | Improved using advanced prompt techniques. |
| **Multiple Versions** | Show differences between prompt strategies. |
| **Final Version** | Polished, corrected, high-quality output. |

---

## **Conclusion**
Using different prompt engineering techniques significantly improves the structure, creativity, and accuracy of AI-generated content. Whether creating reports, case studies, educational materials, or creative stories, structured prompting helps guide ChatGPT to produce coherent, meaningful, and engaging results. This experiment proves that mastering prompt patterns leads to better content quality across all domains.
